# SecuScan

SecuScan is a lightweight Python tool built to help identify basic security vulnerabilities on local systems and small networks. Built by Karmoh Amadou Kamara  (future cybersecurity analyst) it scans for open ports, weak configurations, and risky services — then generates a simple report to help fix them.

## Features
- Port scanner (custom target)
- Banner grabbing (detects weak services)
- Basic vulnerability checks (weak passwords, suspicious startup files)
- PDF/HTML report generator
- Easy to understand, beginner-friendly code

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- socket
- nmap (optional)
- fpdf (for report generation)
- Tkinter (optional GUI)
